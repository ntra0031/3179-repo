            <h2 >There is no question that alcohol has been around for a long time and with it comes the discussion of what a healthy consumption is.
                Every country and culture around the world will have their own views on drinking and while it is more common for some countries such as Italy or Russia for people
                to start drinking when they are younger, it is more frowned upon in others such as Yemen and Pakistan.
