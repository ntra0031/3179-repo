            <h1 >Alcohol: its Consumption and Effects Globally</h1>

            <h2 >There is no question that alcohol has been around for a long time and with it comes the discussion of what a healthy consumption is.
                Every country and culture around the world will have their own views on drinking and while it is more common for some countries such as Italy or Russia for people
                to start drinking when they are younger, it is more frowned upon in others such as Yemen and Pakistan. This page will show the trends of alcohol consumption 
                by different countries, continents and explore whether or not drinking has any effects on different aspects of life.

                This chloropleth map shows the estimated average consumption of alcohol by adults (aged 15+) for one year. The country with the highest consumption rate is Moldova at
                23.01 litres followed by Russia and several countries in the Eastern European areas. 
                There are some countries where data is not available such as Congo and the United States of America which are marked as grey areas.

                    The stacked bar chart shows the distribution of different types of drinks by each continent, it shows that in the majority of the continents, beer is the most
                    popular form of alcohol except for North America and Asia where spirits are more popular. Overall, Europe tops the other continents in terms of consuming the most
                    serves of drinks.

                <p id="heatmapdesc">
                    Usually people think that the drinking rates tend to be higher in urban areas and places such as the cbd, however, reading the heatmap, there is no strong correlation
                    between urban rate which is the percentage of the total population that reside in urban areas and alcohol consumption. Some of the countries with a very high urban rate have
                    lower alcohol intakes than some of the countries with low urban rates!

                    The bubble chart above presents life expectancy and adult mortality by continent and alcohol consumption recorded by capita. As the slider moves from year 2000 to 2015, we can observe that
                    the individual bubbles appear smaller, meaning adult mortality has had a decrease in numbers. The trend in life expectancy has also increased with the majority of the bubbles appearing higher 
                    in the grid. It can also be observed that higher consumption does not have a great impact on life expectancy or mortality as the countries where these figures are low have 
                    some of the higher consumption rates.

                    From what we can see in the scatter plot on the left, there is an overall upwards slope where there is a slight positive correlation between the happiness score and the number
                    of servings of alcohol. Denmark having the highest recorded happiness score at 7.526, consumes 583 servings of drinks compared to the lowest recorded happiness score which is at 3.069
                    from Syria. There are of course multiple factors that contribute to a countriy's happiness however, this shows that there is no negative correlation between emotional health and drinking.

                <p id="plot2desc">
                    The scatterplot on the right shows the relationship between employment rates and alcohol consumption. The plots on the graph do not offer any conclusive trend as there are countries with high
                    emoployment rates in both the higher end and lower end of the consumption scale. For example Uganda has one of the highest employment rates at 83.199 with an alcohol consumption at 16.4 
                    while Madagascar with a similar employment rate has a lower alcohol consumption rate at 1.32.
